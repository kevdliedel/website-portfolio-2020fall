  <p> I was lucky enough to spend about 2 months in Antibes, France, last spring during a study abroad program that was unfortunately shortened due to COVID-19.
    I may have been sent home early, but I still had an amazing experience during my time there.
    A small town located along the Southeastern Coast of France, in the French Riviera region, Antibes is smaller town known as a yachting location. It's found between the larger cities of Nice and Cannes, and is about 30 minutes from both.
    I'm hoping that the pictures I've taken can offer you a small glimpse into the life and culture there.
