  <p> Bethlehem is the city in which I grew up. I spent most of my life there, from when I was born through high school.
    It's a great town in Eastern PA, situated between Philadelphia and New York City, and it's around an hour from both.
    Bethlehem is most well known for it's annual music festival, Musikfest, taking place over 10 days in early August.
    Earlier in the 20th century, Bethlehem was home to one of the largest steel manufacturing plants in the entire country.
    As the need for steel eventually died down, the factories were shut down and sat unused for years.
    Eventually, different people began to take interest in these unused structures and began to repurpose them.
    Today, several areas of this steel plant have been repurposed into a casino, now known as Wind Creek Casino.
    There is also an art and activity center known as Artsquest.
    Along with these, there is also a new hotel and shopping center, all of which utilize the old steel plant structures and buildings!
    Within this page are some pictures that I think help to paint a picture of the town and my experience there. If you'd like to learn more about the area, feel free to click the following link: <a href="https://bethlehempa.org/">Bethlehem Website</a>
