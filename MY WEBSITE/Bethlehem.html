  <p> Bethlehem is the city in which I grew up. I spent most of my life there, from when I was born through high school.
    It's a great town in Eastern PA, situated between Philadelphia and New York City, and it's around an hour from both.
    Bethlehem is most well known for it's annual music festival, Musikfest, taking place over 10 days in early August.
    Within this page are some pictures that I think help to paint a picture of the town and my experience there.
